  {
    "category": "performance",
    "question": "Why are there so many stages for increase in Mileage?",
    "answer": [
      "There are a lot of hydro carbon deposits in the engine which first get cleaned and flushed out into the engine oil. As the carbon deposits flush out, mileage enhances gradually.",
      "For bikes after 500 kms it is mandatory to change the engine oil.",
      "For cars after 1000 kms it is mandatory to change the engine oil.",
      "This is a one-time activity only.",
      "Example: If you replace engine oil every 2000 kms, after installation you replace every 4000 kms."
